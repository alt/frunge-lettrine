# frunge-lettrine

A LaTeX documentclass to insert lettrines at the beginning of every paragraph to simulate the old master’s typesetting.

# Purpose

This package should help you (and in the first place, me) to typeset beatiful book in the style of incunabula. This package provides an easy interface to set big initials at the beginning of every paragraph.

## Usage

Compile the document saying

    xelatex mindmap.tex

and read the created pdf. (Or read the dtx itself, if you’re used to the code.)
