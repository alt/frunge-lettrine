# frunge-lettrine

A LaTeX document class to insert initials at the beginning of every paragraph to simulate the old master’s typesetting.

# Purpose

This package should help you (and in the first place, me) to typeset beautiful books in the style of the old incunabula. The main features are: Multicolored initials at every paragraph and thin lines under each line (as in old handwritings and incunabula).

frunge-lettrine is a wrapper for the great package lettrine by Daniel Flipo. The main purpose is the /automatic/ insertion of an /multicolored/ initial at every paragraph. Last (but not least!) it inserts thin lines.

## Usage

Compile the document saying

    xelatex frunge-lettrine.dtx

and read the created pdf as documentation. (Or read the dtx itself, if you’re used to the code.)
